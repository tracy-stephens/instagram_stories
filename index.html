	   To determine if food has become a more significant part of my life during COVID-19 quarantine, I broke down my Instagram stories over the last two months by those containing food and those not containing food. When I started practicing social distancing in mid-March, my non-food related posts (the cyan line) were roughly as frequent as my food-related posts (the purple line). However, as Iâ€™ve spent more time in quarantine, food has become a more significant part of my life, at least as indicated by my social media posts.
